\title{Essential OCL}
\subtitle{A Study for a Consistent Semantics of UML/OCL 2.3 in HOL}
\subject{Extended Version}
\author{Achim D. Brucker \and Burkhart Wolff}
\begin{abstract}
  At its origins, \OCL was conceived as a strict semantics for
  undefinedness, with the exception of the logical connectives of type
  \inlineocl{Boolean} that constitute a three-valued propositional
  logic.  Recent versions of the \OCL standard added a second
  exception element, which, similar to the null references in
  programming languages, is given a non-strict semantics.

  In this paper, we report on our results in formalizing the core of
  \acs{ocl} in \acf{hol}. This formalization revealed several
  inconsistencies and contradictions in the current version of the
  \acs{ocl} standard.  These inconsistencies and contradictions are
  reflected in the challenge to define and implement \OCL tools in a
  uniform manner.

\section{Introduction}
At its origins~\cite{richters:precise:2002,omg:ocl:1997}, \OCL was
conceived as a strict semantics for undefinedness, with the exception
of the logical connectives of type \inlineocl{Boolean} that constitute
a three-valued propositional logic.  Recent versions of the \OCL
standard~\cite{omg:ocl:2006,omg:ocl:2012} added a second exception
element, which is given a non-strict semantics.  Unfortunately, this
extension results in several inconsistencies and contradictions. These
problems are reflected in difficulties to define interpreters,
code-generators, specification animators or theorem provers for \OCL
in a uniform manner and resulting incompatibilities of various
tools. For the \OCL community, this results in the challenge to define
a new formal semantics definition \OCL that could replace the ``Annex
A'' of the \acs{ocl} standard~\cite{omg:ocl:2012}.
