text{* The pathological case of a type that contains
just null and no other element: *}

type_synonym Void\<^sub>b\<^sub>a\<^sub>s\<^sub>e = "unit option"
type_synonym ('\<AA>)Void = "('\<AA>,Void\<^sub>b\<^sub>a\<^sub>s\<^sub>e) val"
(* For technical reasons, the type does not contain to the null-class yet. *)
text {* This \emph{minimal} OCL type contains only two elements:
@{term "invalid"} and @{term "null"}.
@{term "Void"} could initially be defined as @{typ "unit option option"},
however the cardinal of this type is more than two, so it would have the cost to consider
 @{text "Some None"} and @{text "Some (Some ())"} seemingly everywhere.*}
