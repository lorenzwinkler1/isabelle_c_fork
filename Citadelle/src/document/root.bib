  abstract	= {We present a precise approach that allows an analysis and
		  validation of \acs{uml} models and OCL constraints. We
		  focus on models and constraints specified in the analysis
		  and early design stage of a software development process.
		  For this purpose, a suitable subset of \acs{uml}
		  corresponding to information that is usually represented in
		  class diagrams is identified and formally defined. This
		  basic modeling language provides a context for all OCL
		  constraints. We define a formal syntax and semantics of OCL
		  types, operations, expressions, invariants, and
		  pre-/postconditions. We also give solutions for problems
		  with the current OCL definition and discuss possible
		  extensions. A metamodel for OCL is introduced that defines
		  the abstract syntax of OCL expressions and the structure of
		  types and values. The metamodel approach allows a seamless
		  integration with the \acs{uml} metamodeling architecture
		  and makes the benefits of a precise OCL definition easier
		  accessible. The OCL metamodel also allows to define
		  context-sensitive conditions for well-formed OCL
		  expressions more precisely. These conditions can now be
		  specified with OCL whereas they previously were specified
		  only informally. In order to demonstrate the practical
		  applicability of our work, we have realized substantial
		  parts of it in a tool supporting the validation of models
		  and constraints. Design specifications can be ``executed''
		  and animated thus providing early feedback in an iterative
		  development process. Our approach offers novel ways for
		  checking user data against specifications, for automating
		  test procedures, and for checking CASE tools for standards
		  conformance. Therefore, this work contributes to the goal
		  of improving the overall quality of software systems by
		  combining theoretical and practical techniques.},

		  Current approaches to operation contract simulation exhibit

		  1. Elementary Techniques shows how to model functional
		  programs in higher-order logic. Early examples involve
		  lists and the natural numbers. Most proofs are two steps
		  long, consisting of induction on a chosen variable followed
		  by the auto tactic. But even this elementary part covers
		  such advanced topics as nested and mutual recursion. 2.
		  Logic and Sets presents a collection of lower-level tactics
		  that you can use to apply rules selectively. It also
		  describes Isabelle/\acs{hol}'s treatment of sets, functions
		  and relations and explains how to define sets inductively.
		  One of the examples concerns the theory of model checking,
		  and another is drawn from a classic textbook on formal
		  languages. 3. Advanced Material describes a variety of
		  other topics. Among these are the real numbers, records and
		  overloading. Advanced techniques are described involving
		  induction and recursion. A whole chapter is devoted to an
		  extended example: the verification of a security protocol. },

  abstract	= {From its beginnings, \acs{ocl} is based on a strict
		  semantics for undefinedness, with the exception of the
		  logical connectives of type Boolean that constitute a
		  three-valued propositional logic. Recent versions of the
		  \acs{ocl} standard added a second exception element, which,
		  similar to the null references in object-oriented
		  programming languages, is given a non-strict semantics.
		  Unfortunately, this extension has been done in an ad hoc
		  manner, which results in several inconsistencies and
		  contradictions.
		  
		  In this paper, we present a consistent formal semantics
		  (based on our \holocl approach) that includes such a
		  non-strict exception element. We discuss the possible
		  consequences concerning class diagram semantics as well as
		  deduction rules. The benefits of our approach for the
		  specification-pragmatics of design level operation
		  contracts are demonstrated with a small case-study.},

	abstract	= 	{HOL-OCL is an interactive proof environment for the Object Constraint Language (OCL). It is implemented as a shallow embedding of OCL into the Higher-order Logic (HOL) instance of the interactive theorem prover Isabelle. HOL-OCL defines a machine-checked formalization of the semantics as described in the standard for OCL 2.0. This conservative, shallow embedding of UML/OCL into Isabelle/HOL includes support for typed, extensible UML data models supporting inheritance and subtyping inside the typed lambda-calculus with parametric polymorphism. As a consequence of conservativity with respect to higher-order logic (HOL), we can guarantee the consistency of the semantic model. Moreover, HOL-OCL provides several derived calculi for UML/OCL that allow for formal derivations establishing the validity of UML/OCL formulae. Elementary automated support for such proofs is also provided top},
