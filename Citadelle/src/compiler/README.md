## Acronyms of Citadelle
Due to space and unlimited tweaking reasons, all known acronyms of
Citadelle (only those judged gorgeous) were deconstructed once and for
all, then sorted together:
* and - AST - Castra - Cementing - Citadelle - Coding - Constructive -
  Costras - Down - Earth's - Fortify - Generic - in - Invalid's -
  Isabelle - Isabelle's - Languages' - Meta - ML-like's - Models -
  Null's - Reflected - Supporting - to - Top - Transformer - UML/OCL's

The creation of the acronyms were nevertheless following certain rules
relieving combinatorial blow-up, for instance:
* Length: Unrestricted, but to fit in a top header file, first line
  words were arranged to total less than 65 characters, without
  breaking any words, and 76 for subsequent lines if any.
* Order: They all contain the letters 'Citadelle' in case insensitive
  increasing order.
* Tail Recursivity: Each acronym ends with the word 'Citadelle'.
* Persistence: By removing the last word 'Citadelle', it is still
  possible to find at least another hidden sequence of 'Citadelle'.
