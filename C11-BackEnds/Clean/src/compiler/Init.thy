Finally, we will have a glance at the code for the registration of the annotation commands
used in the example. Thanks to Isabelle/C's function \<^ML>\<open>C_Annotation.command'\<close>, the registration of 
user-defined annotations is very similar to the registration of ordinary commands in the Isabelle
platform.\<close>

        C_Annotation.command' keyword ""
