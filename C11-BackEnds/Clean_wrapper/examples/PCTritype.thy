chapter \<open>Example: Triangle Type \<close>
text\<open>
   A classic example from test generation literature
   which contains no loops or arrays
   but is interesting for its simple example of an oracle.
   This implementation does not handle negative inputs correctly 

   Determines the type of a triangle given its three edges i,j,k 
   \<^enum>   4 = Not a triangle        
   \<^enum>   3 = Equilateral triangle 
   \<^enum>   2 = Isosceles triangle   
   \<^enum>   1 = Any other triangle
