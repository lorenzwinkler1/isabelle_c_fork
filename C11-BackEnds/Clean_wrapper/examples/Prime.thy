chapter \<open>Example: Prime\<close>

text\<open>This example shows how to use nested C-commands in as cascade syntax. 
Note that the innermost "n" inside the \<open>\<^C>\<open>n\<close>\<close> in the pre-condition binds to 
the parameter of the C function across the syntax barriers. Note that
the exported C code does not necessarily respect the lexical conventions of C
(a better implementation of the exporter may solve this.).
