text\<open> Binary search of a given element in a given ordered array
      returning 1 if the element is present and 0 if not.
     
      This example is like Bsearch but contains an error at line 30
      which causes several cases to have a "failure" verdict.
      
      The failed test cases are exactly those which cover the paths
      in which the 1st subcondition of line 30 is satisfied,
      which indicates the location of the error.  \<close>
