section\<open>The C code for \<open>O(sqrt(n))\<close> Primality Test Algorithm\<close>

text\<open> This C code contains a function that determines if the given number 
      @{term n} is prime.

      It returns 0 if @{term n}  is composite, or non-zero if @{term n}  is prime.
 
      This is a faster version than a linear primality test; runs in O(sqrt(n)). \<close>
