text\<open>Bubble sort of a given array 'table' of  a given length 'l' in descending order.

   This example is interesting because of its
   \<^enum> variable dimension input array
   \<^enum> loop with a variable number of iterations,
     which is limited by limiting the array dimension
   \<^enum> oracle which does not sort but checks the result is ordered  \<close>

    void bsort (int * table, int l) 
    {
      int i, temp, nb;

      nb = 0;
      while ( !fini && (nb < l-1)){      /* line 16 */

        for (i=0 ; i<l-1 ; i++)          /* line 18 */
