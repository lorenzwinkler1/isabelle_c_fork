Isabelle/C~\cite{Tuong-IsabelleC:2019} is a C front-end for Isabelle/PIDE providing generic support
for C parsing, editing, and highlighting. Isabelle/C also provides a generic interface for semantic
interpretations of C11 programs and program fragments. In particular, Isabelle/C also offers the
generic framework to define \emph{annotation commands} and \emph{C antiquotations} that can be
custumized to a specific semantic back-end.

The purpose of this session is to provide a substantial show-case demonstrating how this can be done
with Isabelle/C, \ie{} how it can actually be instantiated with a concrete semantic interpretation
(called: semantic back-end theory in this context). For this purpose, we chose the Clean language
which is available via the Isabelle AFP~\cite{journals/afp/TuongW19}.

We show how the translation process from C11-AST's via a C99-AST and its library can be done for
similar semantic back-ends such as AutoCorres (see @{url
  "https://gitlri.lri.fr/ftuong/isabelle_c/tree/C/C11-BackEnds"}) or IMP2.

Isabelle/C as a framework offers:
\<^enum> a C11 AST definition in SML
\<^enum> a C99 AST definition as well as an AST support library in SML
\<^enum> a translator from C11 to C99 AST in SML
\<^enum> an c-environment data-structure managed by Isabelle/C in SML
\<^enum> a generic interface to define \<^emph>\<open>annotation commands\<close>, \ie{} specific pragmas
  of the form \<^verbatim>\<open>/*@ <command> <arg> ... <arg> */\<close> which were executed in the
  logical and C-AST context. 
\<close>

text \<open> The task of constructing a wrapper, \ie{} an instantiation of Isabelle/C with a
specific semantic back-end can be decomposed in essentially three tasks:
\<^enum> Constructing the translation of C11-AST into the terms in the terms provided by
  the Isabelle structure @{ML_structure "Term"}; an intermediate solution is to generate
  string's and to let them parse by the Isabelle parsers. 
\<^enum> Constructing a semantics for the usual C pragmas \<^verbatim>\<open>#define ...\<close>,
  \<^verbatim>\<open>#include ...\<close> and friends; an alternative is to consider only files
  expanded by the C preprocessor. (This solution is disadvised since cpp's tend to be very platform
  specific and expansions might lead to very lengthy sources without modularization
  information. Wasting structural information is a capital sin in an interactive environment.)
\<^enum> Defining control-attributes suitable for the wrapper.
\<^enum> Defining semantic annotation commands yielding specific support for automation.
\<close>

text\<open>Such semantic annotation commands may yield support for:
\<^enum> Classics in verification:
  pre- and post-conditions, rely-guarantees, flags for arithmetic interpretation, 
  assertions, assumptions, invariants. 
\<^enum> Classics in program-based tests such as:
  unfolding-depths, coverage criteria to be applied, hints feasibility-checking.
\<^enum> Isabelle inline proofs establishing properties of local C elements or configuration data
  (Isabelle/C supports proof-carrying code in a sense, see @{cite "Tuong-IsabelleC:2019"} page 9).
\<^enum> Pragmas for code-generation.
\<^enum> Ontological information used to assure tracability of requirements or tests down to
  specific spots in the code (cf. @{cite "brucker.wolff:isadof-design-impl:2019"}). 
\<close>

text\<open>In the sequel, we will present some aspects of the translation, the handling of pragmas
and semantic annotation commands giving specific support for Clean.\<close>

Proof-Carrying Code and Extended-static checking are well-known, related approaches
in the literature.

Proof-carrying code was introduced as concept by @{cite qsd}
(*  
G. Ne cula and P. Lee in 1996 CMU-CS-FOX-96-03.
*)
It is was initially conceived for machine-code, which is annotated with 
logical formulas referring to the underlying machine model. A verification
condition generator produces verification conditions, for which proofs in 
in an LF-like format were provided in an annex of the code. 
The combined code can be loaded from an untrusted provider and checked on loading 
time. The execution has then no further overhead. Note, however, that the code 
size can be essential, depending on the security or functional properties required.
In practice, such approach is restricted to very basic safety properties such as
absence of buffer- or arithmetic overflows. The proof-object checker is conceived
to be light-weighed.

In contrast, extended static checking was conceived at the beginning for code in
a more abstract programming language. Annotated code is passed to the verification
condition generator, which builds formulas over a relatively rich logical context
--- the background theory --- providing rules for more data-structures as well as 
a memory-model coming with some specification mechanism for framing conditions. 
The verification condition generator produced proof obligations which were handled 
by a fairly fat automated theorem prover.
\<close>

text\<open> Isabelle/C supports two variants of extended static checking which we call
\<^emph>\<open>Theories embedding Code (TeC)\<close>  or \<^emph>\<open>Code embedding Theories (CeT)\<close> respectively.
