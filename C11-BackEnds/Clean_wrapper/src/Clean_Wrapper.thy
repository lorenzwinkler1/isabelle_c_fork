text\<open>Isabelle/C ~@{cite "TuongWolff19"} is a C11 ~front-end for Isabelle/PIDE providing 
generic support for C parsing, editing, and highlighting. Isabelle/C also provides 
a generic interface for semantic interpretations of the C11 programs and program
fragments. In particular, Isabelle/C also offers the generic framework
to define \emph{annotation commands} and \emph{C antiquotations} 
that can be custumized to a specific semantic back-end.

The purpose of this session is to provide a substantial show-case demonstrating 
how this can be done with Isabelle/C, \ie{} how it can actually be instantiated 
with a concrete semantic interpretation (called: semantic back-end theory in this
context). For this purpose, we chose the Clean language which is available via
the Isabelle AFP.

We show how the translation process from C11-AST's via a C99-AST and its library 
can be done for similar semantic back-ends such as AutoCorres 
(see @{url "https://gitlri.lri.fr/ftuong/isabelle_c/tree/C/C11-BackEnds"})
or IMP2.

Isabelle/C as a framework offers:
\<^enum> a C11 AST definition in SML
\<^enum> a C99 AST definition as well as an AST support library in SML
\<^enum> a translator from C11 to C99 AST in SML
\<^enum> an c-environment data-structure managed by Isabelle/C in SML
\<^enum> a generic interface to define \<^emph>\<open>annotation commands\<close>, \ie{} specific pragmas
  of the form \<^verbatim>\<open>/*@ <command> <arg> ... <arg> */\<close> which were executed in the
  logical and C-AST context.
