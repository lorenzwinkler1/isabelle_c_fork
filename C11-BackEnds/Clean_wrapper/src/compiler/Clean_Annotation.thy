Finally, we will have a glance at the code for the registration of the annotation commands
used in the example. Thanks to Isabelle/C's function \<^ML>\<open>C_Annotation.command'\<close>, the registration of 
user-defined annotations is very similar to the registration of ordinary commands in the Isabelle
platform.\<close>

ML \<open>local open Clean_Annotation
    in fun command keyword annotation_type =
        C_Annotation.command' keyword ""
          (C_Token.syntax'
            (Parse.token Parse.cartouche)
           >>> map_context_annotation_declaration annotation_type)
    end\<close>    

setup \<open>let open Clean_Annotation
       in command ("pre\<^sub>C\<^sub>l\<^sub>e\<^sub>a\<^sub>n", \<^here>) (Spec "")
       #> command ("post\<^sub>C\<^sub>l\<^sub>e\<^sub>a\<^sub>n", \<^here>) (End_spec "")
       #> command ("inv\<^sub>C\<^sub>l\<^sub>e\<^sub>a\<^sub>n", \<^here>) (Invariant "")
       #> command ("measure\<^sub>C\<^sub>l\<^sub>e\<^sub>a\<^sub>n", \<^here>) (Measure "")
       end\<close>
