chapter \<open>Example: A slightly optimized Sqrt Prime Sample Proof\<close>

text\<open>This example is used to demonstrate Isabelle/C/AutoCorres in a version that keeps
the theory development of the background theory as well as the program annotations completely 
\<^emph>\<open>outside\<close> the C source. This particular development style that keeps the program
separate from its theory we call TCC (\<^emph>\<open>Theories Carrying Code\<close>). It has the 
advantage that developers of development and verification teams can be separated,
as is required by many certification standards.
Note that the opposite style that we call CCT (\<^emph>\<open>Code-carrying Theories\<close>) is also 
supported by Isabelle/C. In CCT style, Programs become a kind of ``proof-carrying (high-level) code''.
Exports of the C-sources will contain their theory (not only their annotations) as comments
\<^emph>\<open>inside\<close> which might be also useful in certification as well as advanced  
``proof-carrying code'' securization schemes of server platforms. 

Of course, since developments can mix C code and HOL developments in an arbitrary manner,
these two style have to be thought of as extremes in a continuum. \<close>
