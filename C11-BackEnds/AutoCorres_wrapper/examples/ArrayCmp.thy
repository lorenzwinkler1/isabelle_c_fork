The program compares (with respect to the lexicographic order) the subarrays
with the first n elements of given arrays t1 and t2. The return values are
\<^enum>   0 if the subarrays are equal,
\<^enum>   1 if the subarray in t1 is greater than in t2,
\<^enum>  -1 if the subarray in t2 is greater than in t1 \<close>
