chapter\<open>Example \<close>

text \<open> This example is used to demonstrate Isabelle/C/AutoCorres in a version that uses
AutoCorres Annotations addressed to AutoCorres. The example annotation is found in the C function
\<open>g\<close>. Note that this proceeding is not necessarily recommended --- since AutoCorres does
not support semantic PIDE support, editing feedback is limited and the workflow somewhat
clumpsy. \<close>
