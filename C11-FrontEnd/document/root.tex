\begin{abstract}
Isabelle/C is a C front-end for Isabelle. Isabelle/C can as well be seen as a meta-language for
Isabelle, i.e., pretty much resembling to Isabelle/ML, but composed of an infrastructure to parse C
code and directly apply \emph{semantic back-ends}.

Thus, the choice of language(s) in which semantic back-ends should be written is multiple: we have
working prototypes implemented in either HOL or ML --- with this work, a next typical implementation
of choice would be C.

In return, theorems and proofs generated by semantic back-ends get ultimately evaluated in ML, with
a performance natively efficient (or close).\cite{brucker.ea:featherweight:2014}
