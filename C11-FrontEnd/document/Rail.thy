  \<^descr> \<^theory_text>\<open>C_file name\<close> resembles to
  \<^theory_text>\<open>ML_file name\<close>: it reads the given C
  file, and let any attached semantic back-ends to proceed for further
  subsequent evaluation. Top-level C bindings are stored within the
  (global or local) theory context; the initial environment is set by
  default to be an empty one, or the one returned by a previous
  \<^theory_text>\<open>C_file\<close> (depending on @{attribute_def
    C_propagate_env}). Multiple \<^theory_text>\<open>C_file\<close>
  commands may be used to build larger C projects if they are all
  written in a single theory file (existing parent theories are
  ignored, and not affecting the current working theory).

  \<^descr> \<^theory_text>\<open>C\<close> is similar to
  \<^theory_text>\<open>C_file\<close>, but evaluates directly the
  given \<open>text\<close>. Top-level resulting bindings are stored
  within the (global or local) theory context.

  \<^descr> \<^theory_text>\<open>C_export_boot\<close> is similar to
  \<^theory_text>\<open>ML_export\<close>, except that the code in
  input is understood as being processed by
  \<^theory_text>\<open>C\<close> instead of \<^theory_text>\<open>ML\<close>.

  \<^descr> \<^theory_text>\<open>C_prf\<close> is similar to
  \<^theory_text>\<open>ML_prf\<close>, except that the code in input
  is understood as being processed by
  \<^theory_text>\<open>C\<close> instead of \<^theory_text>\<open>ML\<close>.

  \<^descr> \<^theory_text>\<open>C_val\<close> is similar to
  \<^theory_text>\<open>ML_val\<close>, except that the code in input
  is understood as being processed by
  \<^theory_text>\<open>C\<close> instead of \<^theory_text>\<open>ML\<close>.

  \<^descr> \<^theory_text>\<open>C_export_file\<close> dumps all
  existing previous C code to \<open>T.c\<close>, where
  \<open>T.thy\<close> is the name of the current working theory. The
  dump is actually restricted to \<open>T\<close> (parent theories are
  ignored).

text \<open>

  \<^descr> @{attribute C_lexer_trace} indicates whether the list of C
  tokens associated to the source text should be output (that list is
  computed during the lexing phase).

  \<^descr> @{attribute C_parser_trace} indicates whether the stack
  forest of Shift-Reduce node should be output (it is the final stack
  which is printed, i.e., the one taken as soon as the parsing
  terminates).

  \<^descr> @{attribute C_ML_verbose} indicates whether nested
  \<^theory_text>\<open>ML\<close> commands are acting similarly as
  their default verbose configuration in top-level.

  \<^descr> @{attribute_def C_propagate_env} makes the start of a C
  command (e.g., \<^theory_text>\<open>C_file\<close>,
  \<^theory_text>\<open>C\<close>) initialized with the environment of
  the previous C command if existing.
