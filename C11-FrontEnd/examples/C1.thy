text \<open>In terms of execution order, nested ML code are not pre-filtered out of the C code, but
executed when the C parser is in an intermediate parsing state of having already read all previous
tokens, constructed for each read token a respective temporary parsed subtree
(to be included in the final value), and about to read the ML code.

Moreover, the ML code can get access to the current parsing state (represented as a stack of parsed
values). Because values in the state are changing depending on where the ML code is situated,
we can conveniently use ML antiquotations for printing and reporting actions.\<close>

text \<open>The special \<open>@\<close> symbol makes the command be executed whenever the first element \<open>E\<close>
 in the stack is about to be irremediably replaced by a more structured parent element (having \<open>E\<close>
as one of its direct children). It is the parent element which is provided to the ML code.

Instead of always referring to the first element of the stack, 
\<open>N\<close> consecutive occurrences of \<open>@\<close> will make the ML code getting as argument the direct parent
of the \<open>N\<close>-th element.\<close>

text \<open>\<open>&\<close> behaves as \<open>@\<close>, but instead of always giving the designated direct parent to the ML code,
it finds the first parent ancestor making non-trivial changes in the respective grammar rule
(a non-trivial change can be for example the registration of the position of the current AST node
being built).\<close>
