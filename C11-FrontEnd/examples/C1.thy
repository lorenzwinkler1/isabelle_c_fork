section \<open>C Annotations\<close>

subsection \<open>Actions on the Parsing Stack\<close>

text \<open> The \<^theory_text>\<open>C\<close> command resembles to
\<^theory_text>\<open>ML\<close> except that the syntax of the code written inside
\<^theory_text>\<open>C\<close> is the syntax of C11 (at the time of writing). Additionally, it is
possible to write commands in C comments, called annotation commands, such as
\<^theory_text>\<open>\<approx>setup\<close>. \<close>

C \<comment> \<open>Nesting ML code in C comments\<close> \<open>
int a = (((0))); /*@ \<approx>setup \<open>@{print_stack}\<close> */
                 /*@ \<approx>setup \<open>@{print_top}\<close> */
\<close>

text \<open> In terms of execution order, nested annotation commands are not pre-filtered out of the
C code, but executed when the C code is still being parsed. Since the parser implemented is a LALR
parser \<^footnote>\<open>\<^url>\<open>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LALR\<close>\<close>, C tokens
are uniquely read and treated from left to right. Thus, each nested command is (supposed by default
to be) executed when the parser has already read all C tokens before the comment associated to the
nested command, so when the parser is in a particular intermediate parsing step (not necessarily
final)
\<^footnote>\<open>\<^url>\<open>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-reduce_parser\<close>\<close>. \<close>

text \<open>The command \<^theory_text>\<open>\<approx>setup\<close> is similar to the command
\<^theory_text>\<open>setup\<close> except that it takes a function with additional arguments. These
arguments are precisely depending on the current parsing state. To better examine these arguments,
it is convenient to use ML antiquotations (be it for printing, or for doing any regular ML actions
like PIDE reporting).

Ultimately, in contrast with \<^theory_text>\<open>setup\<close>, the return type of the
\<^theory_text>\<open>\<approx>setup\<close> function is not
\<^ML_type>\<open>theory -> theory\<close> but
\<^ML_type>\<open>Context.generic -> Context.generic\<close>. \<close>

text \<open>The special \<open>@\<close> symbol makes the command be executed whenever the first element \<open>E\<close>
 in the stack is about to be irremediably replaced by a more structured parent element (having \<open>E\<close>
as one of its direct children). It is the parent element which is provided to the ML code.

Instead of always referring to the first element of the stack, 
\<open>N\<close> consecutive occurrences of \<open>@\<close> will make the ML code getting as argument the direct parent
of the \<open>N\<close>-th element.\<close>

text \<open>\<open>&\<close> behaves as \<open>@\<close>, but instead of always giving the designated direct parent to the ML code,
it finds the first parent ancestor making non-trivial changes in the respective grammar rule
(a non-trivial change can be for example the registration of the position of the current AST node
being built).\<close>
